# 🌐 Frontend Practice Projects

Welcome to my **Frontend Practice** repository! This is a collection of hands-on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript mini-projects I’ve built to strengthen my frontend development skills. Each file or folder represents a new layout, component, or challenge I’ve taken on as part of my journey to becoming a better web developer.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

🔹 **HTML & CSS Layouts**  
From simple structures to modern layouts using grid and flexbox.

🔹 **Parts of Popular Websites**  
In this project, I’ve recreated **small components or sections** (not full home pages) from popular websites like Google, Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn, and others. These are UI elements such as navbars, search boxes, buttons, login sections, product cards, etc.

🔹 **Responsive Designs**  
Practices on making pages adaptable across different screen sizes.

🔹 **Interactive Elements**  
Buttons, image hover effects, transitions, forms, and more with CSS and JavaScript.

🔹 **Images & Media**  
Incorporated visuals to simulate real-world web design.
